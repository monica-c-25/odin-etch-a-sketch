# odin-etch-a-sketch
In this project I created a hybrid of a sketchpad and the classic Etch-A-Sketch! Features include a button for a grid size option that allows the user to input a grid size via prompt and a clear board button. The grid is filled with random RGB colors as the user starts drawing.
